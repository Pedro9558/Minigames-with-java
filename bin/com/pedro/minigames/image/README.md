# Creating your own Hangman Head

## Requirements
1. A 50x50 .png image (It's strongly recommended that you use one of the headbaseskins included in this file)
2. The name: Must be "head" followed by the next number in the sequence, example the last head sequence included in this file is "head7.png", so the next head must be "head8.png" then "head9.png", etc. Anything else may cause conflict on the program

## Usage
After doing all the steps within the **Requirements** then all you have to do is to copy the image of the head you made and put it inside the jar file, on the location **/com/pedro/minigames/image**, and once you start the application, your head may be used on generating the Hangman! :)
