# Minigames on Java

## Description
This is a small project containing some classic minigames made on Java, created mostly for fun and to help me improve my programming skills :)

## Contents
1. Games:
   - **Hangman**: A classic game of hangman with customizable heads and random Hangman generation! So far there's only 3 themes, there may be more on the future!
   - **Tic Tac Toe**: Another classic game where you can play with a friend or against an AI! Or if you want to, you can make 2 AIs fight eachother on a classic Tic Tac Toe match!

2. Animated Components:
   - Some components in the screens have some cool animations! From "blinking" to a classic "sliding" animation!

3. Sound Support:
   - This application supports playing sounds, so you may notice there's some music and some sound effects, thanks to a simple Audio Library implemented using java AudioClip, but there's still room for more if you want to implement your own Audio Library!
